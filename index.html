            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or group of files over time so that you can go back analyze past revisions to the files. The most favored Version Control method is to copy files into another directory. Version Control Systems allow you to revert files back to their previous state. This topic interests me because as a beginner to coding, often times many changes are made to my files and it makes it easier to understand where I went wrong. This topic is important to the class because Version Control is the basis of GitHub, which is essential to the class.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p>Git allows you to have the entire history of your project right there on your local database or disk making the action of retrieving the information almost instantaneous as it reads the information directly from the disk. Compared to other VCS’s, Git is easy to use with a simple design while also being fast and supportive for large projects since other users are allowed to work on the project at any time. I found this interesting because it is a major component of our class and it is important to understand the workings of popular and efficient technology. This is relevant to our class because every project will be pushed into their local and remote repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a git repository that resides on a remote server on a network or the Internet that is shared between multiple group members. When in use, collaborators of the project will push and pull data to a from where the work is shared. I found this to be interesting because we will be using GitHub and git in this class quite frequently and GitHub acts as a remote repository. It is important to understand what GitHub actually is and why we use it. This topic is relevant to our class because in order to share our work with our professor or our fellow classmates, a remote repository must be used. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a repository that resides on a local machine or computer of an individual. The two ways to create a local repository is by creating a new one or cloning an existing remote repository onto the local machine. Local repository is an example of a distribute version control system. I found this interesting because locally having a full repository history is extremely useful. You can even create a local repository from a remote repository using the Git clone command. This is relevant to our class because local repositories are origin of most files before they are moved to the remote repository. Understanding the two types is helpful when placing files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the largest host for Git repositories and is the central point of collaboration millions of developers and projects. GitHub allows developers to keep their files organized and gives them the ability to go back or undo previous changes. In simpler terms, GitHub is like a social networking site for programmers since they get to share and edit each other’s code. This was interesting to me because I was amazed with the progressiveness of the idea that large changes can be made to a code without having to connect to any server every time you decide to make a change when using GitHub. This is relevant to our course because it is clear that GitHub is the future of version control. </p>
