## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Within Git, there are three main stages that a file can reside in- committed, modified and staged.
2. In order to obtain a Git repository, you can either use a new local directory and create a new repository or you can clone an existing Git repository.
3. The git status command tells you the state of the working directory and the staging area. It also tells you which changes have or haven't been staged and which files aren't being tracked.
